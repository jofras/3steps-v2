                    In order to achieve the greatest possible training effect, we train very intensively during
                    our programs, but still with joy. Each player is treated individually. The focus is on the
                    individual and we consistently work on personal skills.

                <p className="text-gray-600 text-base md:text-lg mt-3">
                    We mainly focus on technical skills:

                </ul>
                <p className="text-gray-600 text-base md:text-lg mt-3">
                    These three core areas symbolize our 3 steps in training. Through targeted exercises, we
                    improve not only technique but also understanding of the game and game intelligence.

                    Our aim is to improve the players in a playful way, with enthusiasm, but also with the
                    necessary toughness, so that they can successfully apply what they have learned in
                    competition.
